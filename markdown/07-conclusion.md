# Satisficing <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

Hiring the right people is not a optimisation, it's satisficing.

<!-- Note -->
When looking for and recruiting employees, many companies make the following mistake: they try (sometimes really, sometimes pretend) to fill a position with the best possible person.
In other words, they see filling a vacancy as an optimisation task.

In very few cases this is actually necessary, sometimes even mandatory: in the public sector in Germany, for example, the [principle of best selection according to Art. 33(2) GG](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artikel_33_des_Grundgesetzes_f%C3%BCr_die_Bundesrepublik_Deutschland#Prinzip_der_Bestenauslese,_Art._33_Absatz_2_GG) applies.
Here, the most suitable option for filling a vacancy must actually be chosen by law.

In the vast majority of other cases, however, filling a vacancy is much closer to a [satisficing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing) task: in this case, the *first* option that fulfils the decision criteria is chosen for a decision. 
In other words, in extreme cases, the first applicant who fulfils the defined requirements.

Of course, this assumes that the requirements are precisely defined, but we have already defined this as an opening condition at the beginning anyway (remember the detail I require in job descriptions).

This not only shortens the process immensely, it also doesn't turn it into an unnecessary science.
Hiring is and remains a craft that you can and must learn as a manager.


# Training <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

Training and education are management responsibilities too.

<!-- Note -->
If you only ever look for senior people, don't be surprised if the company looks predominantly old, white and male.

You can't just hire people who can already do everything, and if you try to do that, then please don't be surprised at their salary expectations.

You have a responsibility and, in my opinion, also an obligation to accompany people from one level of experience to the next or the next but one.

And you will also achieve better performance, better team quality and more diversity than with a headhunting strategy.

# Cleura Cloud Academy (1) <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

<!-- Note -->
... and this, as it happens, is what I work on with my team: we run Cleura Cloud Academy, which is our platform for training our own employees on technologies that we ourselves use, both in production and in evaluation.
Here is an example course.
