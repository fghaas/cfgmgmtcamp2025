# Challenges in Hiring <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

We can't find people! <!-- .element class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->

We can't find good people! <!-- .element class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->

We keep finding the same kind of people! <!-- .element class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->

<!-- Note -->
Essentially, most companies have one or more of the following three problems:

1. they don't get any applications at all.
   This is usually a question of visibility, but also of the quality of job adverts.

2. they get a lot of applications, but there is never anyone who is the right fit.
   This is *often* a problem with the quality of the job adverts, but it can also be that the company makes itself unattractive to good people during the application process.

3. they have no problem finding applicants, but they all look the same (university degree, white, male, between 30 and 50).
   And (to their credit) they realise that this doesn't really have to be the case.
   These are mostly problems in the organisation itself.
