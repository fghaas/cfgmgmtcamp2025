# Recruiting (Definition) <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

<span class="fragment fade-in">Recruiting</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">is attracting new employees,</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">done by someone who the new employee neither directly nor indirectly will report to.</span>

<span class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">An organisation may have its own recruiters</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">or outsource recruiting to an agency.</span>

<!-- Note -->
*Recruiting* is distinguished from *hiring* in the English language:

Recruiting usually means bringing in new employees by people who these new employees will not report to.
This can be done by the HR department, or even outside the company by outsourcing it to an agency.

Hiring, by contrast, refers to the more traditional form of employee recruitment, where managers find and hire their own reports.

Question:

1. according to this definition, who does *recruiting?
2. who is a manager themselves?
3. and who of those who raised their hand last rely mainly on those who raised their hand first when recruiting?


# Recruiting <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

Recruiting 
<span class="fragment fade-in">exists where management doesn't do its job.</span>

<!-- Note -->
I have to say something unpleasant to those who raised their hands in the first round: you should find another job.

Not because you do it badly, quite the opposite: firstly, I'm not entitled to judge, and secondly, I have no reason to assume anything other than that you do it well.

It's because the main reason it exists is because they don't - or aren't allowed to - do theirs in the last hand-up round.


# Managers' jobs <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

It's a manager's job to
<span class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">find good people,</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">make them part of a team,</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">define clear objectives</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">and remove any obstacles that may exist between the team and those objectives.</span>

<!-- Note -->
And if you no longer fulfil one of these tasks, then you are no longer a manager.

... and there is no excuse ‘but the division of labour!’

Anyone who hands over a core task to someone else (not in the form of delegation, but by handing over responsibility) is simply no longer performing it.

If a baker no longer bakes bread, but only prepares bread and then sells it in his shop, then he is a bread merchant, not a baker.

So: **you** managers need to think about what kind of people you want in your team.

Not the HR department, not a recruiting agency. You.
