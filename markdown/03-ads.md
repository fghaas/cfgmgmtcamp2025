What belongs in a good job advert?

<!-- Note -->
I'll be confident bordering on arrogance for a moment: I write good job adverts.

I know this not only from conversations with applicants who tell me this in interviews.
I also regularly hear things like ‘I'm happy where I am right now, but if I were looking for a job, I'd apply straight away, and what's more, this is the best job description I've ever read.’
My job descriptions make the rounds when I send them out because people like to read them and like to pass them on.

And my job descriptions are long.
And contrary to popular lore, applicants do typically read them very carefully.

And: writing a good job advert saves you a lot of work in the interview process.
So put in the work, it will pay off.

You only have to do a lot of it once from scratch and can then use it again for every other job advert.

<!-- Note -->
* What is this about? - 1-sentence description of the job
* What will I be working on? - More details about the systems/processes/responsibilities associated with the job.
* What should I know - knowledge requirements: what knowledge/experience is *essential*.
* What can I learn? - Opportunities for acquiring new knowledge or skills.
* What communities am I involved in? - People and communities *outside* the organisation that the person could contribute to.
* Who is my direct supervisor? - Information about you. (Yes, you write this yourself.)
* How is work in your organisation? - Information about the organisational culture and processes. Is it an office-based company? Hybrid? Remote? Are there any special security requirements? What working language(s) does the company use?
* What does my team look like? - Team composition and culture. How big is the team? Is there gender parity? Where do the team members live? How do they communicate?
* What does my working week look like? - Information about the daily/weekly work organisation. How many meetings are there per week? Are there daily standups (shudder)?
* Where can I work from? - Are there things to consider regarding the place of residence or stay (e.g. only within the EU, not in the USA, etc.)?
* Can I work from home - information about working from home. If 100% remote is possible, this should also include how many times a year this is possible. 
* What time zone do I work in - Most teams have a working day aligned to a specific time zone and employees adapt to this. But there may also be shift work, and then people can also work anti-cyclically (e.g. ‘night owl’ in Europe works the US day shift).
* Is travel part of the job? - this applies to travelling to customers, but also to other company locations (e.g. quarterly developer sprints)
* What contract terms apply? - If there are standard contracts, you can describe them here. Overtime regulations, holidays, sick leave, home office support, etc.
* When would I start - Don't assume that all applicants are always immediately available. People have notice periods. Write in what would be the earliest and latest possible start date for the position.
* What would I earn? - Salary. More on this in a moment.
* How do I apply? - Details and deadlines for the application process.
* What happens afterwards? - How does the selection process work? Are there interviews afterwards? If so, with whom? How long does the process take and how much time does it take?


## Salary

... is a number.

<!-- Note -->
... and not some wishy-washy phrase like ‘pay according to qualifications’, or ‘according to the collective bargaining agreement, classification whatever, which won't mean anything to a person outside your country.

You have a budget for the position anyway.
Add a margin for negotiation from the amount and write the figure in.

You'll potentially save yourself *and your applicants* a whole lot of headaches.

There's nothing more stupid than putting someone through 3 interviews, coming to the conclusion that he/she would be perfect for the job, only to then not be able to offer them a salary that even somehow fits their life situation.

This is nothing but wasted time and pure frustration for that person *and for you.

Don't hurt yourself, just write it in.

And: Salaries can be adjusted in line with purchasing power, depending on where a person lives.
But you have to be transparent about this beforehand.

For example: ‘For full-time employment in [country], a monthly salary of € 5,900 gross applies for this position. If you live in another EU country, the salary will be adjusted according to the World Bank's purchasing power parity calculator.’

Simple and easy to understand at any time. See also: [PPP Salary Converter](https://www.chrislross.com/PPPConverter/)


## Remote

... means 100% remote.

<!-- Note -->
If you advertise a job as ‘remote work possible’, then for people in this century that means: ‘I have the opportunity to work 100% from home’ (at best with the exception of on-site meetings once a quarter and 1 all-hands per year).

‘1 day a week in the office’, “3 days a month in the office” - that's not 100% remote.
And people to whom you try to sell something like this as remote work will categorise you as clueless and abandon the application process in annoyance.

Of course, it's also possible that you are a completely distributed organisation, but then it will say ‘remote work’ without ‘possible’.

I would strongly recommend that you have at least a 100% remote option.

Why? Because otherwise you are excluding a very talented pool of potential applicants, namely all those who have any family commitments.
(One can and should discuss whether it is necessary that family and care work is often one-sided and unfairly distributed in our country.
But you *don't* make the situation any better if you don't offer people with such obligations any useful work and development opportunities).

If you do this wilfully, then you needn't be surprised if you have a lot of men sitting there without children (or without interest in their children).

And it'll be Your Own Damn Fault.


## Deadlines

<!-- Note -->
"We will accept applications for this position from 2025-03-01 00:00 to 2025-03-15 23:59 UTC.

Within this period, the order in which applications are received is irrelevant."



## Next steps

<!-- Note -->
"After the application deadline, we will invite the top-ranked applicants to personal interviews.
A total of 3 rounds of interviews are planned within 10 calendar days, which will take place via video conference.
Please allow 45-60 minutes for each round of interviews."

What does that do?

You clearly define the expectations.

Everyone knows exactly when the application must be received and that no further feedback (apart from an autoreply) will be received before then.

And you can also filter out (or add to the queue) all those who send the application *before* the application deadline because they obviously can't or don't want to read.
