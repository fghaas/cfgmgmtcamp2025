# Interviews

<!-- Note -->
So you've found some applicants that you want to get to know better.
Congratulations!

Now it's usually time for job interviews.

And at this point, I think it's particularly important to make it clear right from the start what the scope and content of the interview will be.

Here is the format I use:


# Interview sequence <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

1. Direct manager <!-- .element class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
2. Colleagues <!-- .element class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
3. HR <!-- .element class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->

<!-- Note -->
The first step is a conversation with me.
There are of course detailed notes on this in our wiki.

If I am convinced that it could be a good fit, there will be another interview within a few days, during which 1-2 team members will talk to the applicant.
They also take detailed notes again.

And if we jointly come to the conclusion that we would like to have the person in our team, then there is another interview with someone from the HR department, but this only deals with formal criteria that may stand in the way of employment.

And then there is a written draft contract.
All in all, the interviews for one person never take longer than 2 weeks, but we try to fit it into 1 week.
