"Skilled labour shortage!" "We can't find any good people!" "We'd love to hire more women, but none are applying!" - If these kinds of sentences are flying around in your company, then it's doing something very wrong.

And a lot of companies are doing something very wrong.
Not just since Covid and lockdowns - some companies have actually done a lot of things right; they just promptly forgot about it.

And today they often find themselves desperately looking for

* for people at all,
* for good people,
* or at least for new people.

And that is actually strange.

Because for at least 30 years, the open source community - and the companies that align themselves with it - have shown how to set themselves up to attract really good people.

And I would like to point out some of these things - namely: both what most companies are doing wrong and what the open source community in general is doing right.
How many organisations shoot themselves in the foot with beautiful regularity and laser-like precision.
And how you can get really good employees with a few very simple measures.
