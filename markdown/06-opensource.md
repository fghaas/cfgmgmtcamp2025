# Open source <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

What organinsations can learn from the open source software community

<!-- Note -->
How a company can position itself **without** scaring people away is something you can learn from the open source software community (and from companies that orientate themselves on it).

And not just since yesterday: we have known how to work in a distributed, asynchronous and efficient way for at least 20 years.

Mårten Mickos, 2011

<!-- Note -->
This is a presentation from November 2011 in which Mårten Mickos (former head of MySQL AB) describes the organisation of his company from around 2000 until its sale to Sun in 2008.

It contains everything we understand today as contemporary distributed working: 

* Over 70% of the workforce works from home (and many teams 100%)
* There is an all-hands meeting once a year
* Communication is always asynchronous and written down
* Supervision by managers is cancelled because it makes no sense

And you can also see other principles here that are clearly internalised by the open source software community.


## Work is distributed <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

Work is distributed by default.

<!-- Note -->
By default, tasks are completed regardless of the location of individual persons.
All work tools are designed with this in mind.


## Work is asynchronous <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

Work is asynchronous by default.

<!-- Note -->
In principle, tasks are completed without the need for synchronised coordination.

Ideas such as pair programming or joint hackathons can therefore never become the norm, but are always exceptional cases: each person always works according to their own schedule.


## Communication means writing <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

Communication is always in writing and embedded in a defined context.

<!-- Note -->
Not only are communication channels generally written, but contextual channels are also preferred over non-contextual ones.

That's why so much communication happens in code reviews, in bug trackers, and in threads on mailing lists or discussion forums.

Communication in interactive chat channels, on the other hand, is intended to fill the gaps between these context-orientated media and is rarely project-based.


## Synchronisation is deliberate <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

Synchronisation points are pre-planned, limited, documented, and always include a brief and debrief.

<!-- Note -->
There may be mandatory synchronisation points, e.g. weekly meetings in a chat channel, quarterly sprint meetings or even annual developer conferences.

However, these are always planned in advance, limited in time, documented for posterity and always have predefined preparation and follow-up.

Ad hoc synchronisation points along the lines of ‘everyone in my office, now’ are practically non-existent in open source projects.


## This works in companies too  <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

... and yes, you can do the same in a company.

<!-- Note -->
And if you do that, then you get really good people.

If you choose not to: well, that's Your Own Damn Fault.

So, and now two final remarks:
