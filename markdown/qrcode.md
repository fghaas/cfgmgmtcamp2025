<!-- Note -->
A few words in advance about accessibility:

If you open this QR code on your phone or tablet, you can follow the talk on your own device.

The slides on your device will run in sync with mine here.

Please do this especially if you're visually impaired or are sitting far back.

If you are sensitive to light or prone to migraines and therefore cannot stare at the bright screen for a lengthy time, please select the small blue link at the bottom left, where you can choose the dark theme.

And if you have a hearing impairment, please open the link on your laptop and click on ‘s’, then you will get me with a transcript.
