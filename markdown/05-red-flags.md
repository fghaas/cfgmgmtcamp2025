If you've ever wondered what could stop people from working for you, here's something interesting, namely typical warning signs that often show up for applicants during the application process.

And if you've never asked yourself this before, then it's about time.


## AI Personality Snake Oil

<!-- Note -->
If your application process is somehow based on the alleged use of artificial intelligence to separate suitable from unsuitable applicants, then you've already lost out on people with *natural* intelligence.

It's snake oil, voodoo, homeopathy, Bach flowers for recruiters.
Stop with the nonsense.

And, just to illustrate: any AI solution is only as good as its training data.
In the HR sector in particular, it is extremely important to avoid [algorithmic bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias).

Someone once tried to sell me an AI personality test as a mandatory part of the recruitment process.
I asked what they were doing to avoid algorithmic bias in their solution.

There are few good answers and many bad ones.
But the worst answer imaginable was the one I got: "what's algorithmic bias?"


## Numbers, not People

<!-- Note -->
In my opinion, there is a very unfortunate trend in many organisations, namely that people often switch laterally from the financial to the personnel track.

This then leads to numbers people suddenly having to think about other people - and they quickly become just numbers.

This is particularly noticeable in the fact that scores and key figures are attached to everything.

You can also tell by the new German term â€˜human resourcesâ€™. 
(If you call personnel â€˜resourcesâ€™, you have to put up with being called â€˜overheadsâ€™ yourself).

If an intelligent person realises this during the application process, there are only 2 options:

* Either they run away and tell all their acquaintances what's going on in your company.
* Or they decide to game the system, because they know how easy it is to manipulate.
* In both cases, the consequence is that you have more and more people in the company who manipulate the system to their own advantage.

If you actually **want** those people, fine --- but then it'll be Your Own Damn Fault.

Finance people seem to forget one thing: what people do in IT is just always use broken stuff to their own advantage.

(We have taught sand to think.)

And that always applies to broken KPI systems too.

Please acquaint yourself with things like [Goodhart's law, Campbell's law, the McNamara fallacy](https://xahteiwi.eu/blog/2021/11/14/meaningless-metrics-treacherous-targets/).


## Daily standups

<!-- Note -->
You should know that people who are used to working from home, asynchronous coordination and writing are also expecting managers to know these skills.

If a company cultivates something like a daily stand-up, where everyone just says what they're working on and where there's a problem, then there are only two possible reasons for such people: 

* functional illiteracy among colleagues, especially the inability to write, and/or
* functional illiteracy among managers, especially the inability to read.

If you have that, then you will attract people who want that, and they won't be the ones who are good at contemporary, asynchronous communication: and that'll be Your Own Damn Fault.


## Remote Office

<!-- Note -->
Another phenomenon that will drive good people far away from you is what I call the â€˜remote officeâ€™.

This is a working environment in which everyone is 100% remote, but nobody has thought about the fact that this also means 100% distributed and asynchronous.
And where instead you try to run an office-based company, but without an office, but with all the stupidities that are unfortunately somehow accepted in offices.

The signs and warning signs of a remote office are

* everyone is constantly in unprepared video meetings whose motivation consists solely of â€˜do you have a momentâ€™
* managers always need information *immediately,* and ping colleagues wildly in the chat
* When something important happens, some boss calls *everyone* into a hasty video meeting instead of sitting down and writing an email
* it is tolerated when people come to meetings completely unprepared, especially those who are higher up the food chain
* issue trackers (such as Jira, Taiga, Trello and the like) tolerate comments such as â€˜I haven't read the whole thread but here's my opinionâ€™
* Managers have dystopian surveillance fantasies

Remote offices have unfortunately become something of a norm during Covid lockdowns.

But that doesn't excuse the fact that they still exist now.

If you really **want** to run a remote office and scare away good people: that's Your Own Damn Fault.
